TravelTide is an innovative e-booking startup that emerged in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since launching in April 2021, it has quickly gained traction in the online travel space thanks to its best-in-class data aggregation and search capabilities. Today, it boasts the largest travel inventory available in the industry—making it a go-to platform for millions of users.
While this narrow focus on inventory and search technology has driven growth, it has also left parts of the customer experience underdeveloped—especially when it comes to retention. To address this, TravelTide has welcomed Elena Tarrant as the new Head of Marketing. Elena is a recognized expert in customer retention and rewards strategy. Her goal: launch a personalized rewards program that keeps customers coming back.
I’m part of the Analytics team supporting Elena’s mission. Our role is to uncover actionable insights from customer behavior and ensure the rewards program is data-driven and effective. We’ll validate which perks resonate most—like free checked bags or exclusive discounts—and build customer segments so that marketing messages are tailored to each user’s preferences.
We’ll focus our analysis on a high-intent user group: those with more than 7 sessions between January 4, 2023 and the latest available data. From there, we’ll explore multiple customer cohorts and refine our approach based on what the data tells us.
With Elena’s strategic vision and our data expertise, this project aims to create a compelling and personalized customer experience that boosts retention and long-term loyalty.
